# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application where users can create and review campgrounds. To review or create a campground, users must have an account. This project is part of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

The project is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, with Passport.js handling authentication.

## Functionalities

- **View Campgrounds and Reviews:** Everyone can view campgrounds and reviews without signing up or logging in.
- **User Authentication:** Users must log in to edit campground details or any comments.
- **Ownership:** Users can only edit/delete the campgrounds and comments that they have added.
- **Persistent Data:** All data is stored persistently in the Amazon cloud.

## Technologies Used
